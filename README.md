# IMAGE 2 ASCII Art
This project is a simple IMAGE to ASCII ART converter.

The pixels of the image are mapped different Characters depending on its brightness density.
The more brighter a pixel is, a less dense character is chosen since the characters are of black font colour.
The string of characters that have varying density is '@#W$9876543210?!abc;:+=-,._' --> "@" most dense and " " the least dense character.

To increase the clarity of the generated ascii image one can add extra number of spaces at the end of Density string. More the spaces, better the quality of produced image.
